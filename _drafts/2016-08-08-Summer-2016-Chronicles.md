# TL;DR

One could say that this summer has been life changing in multiple aspects for me. 
At the end of April I was married to the love of my life, Alyssa.
Following our reception in Utah we travelled to Florida for a reception in my hometown.
Then we spent the rest of the summer in Boston for an internship with Harvard Medical School.
There were many happy moments as well as moments of learning, but we are pleased with our first summer together.

## The _big_ day

It was a cool 66&deg; F the day of our wedding.
I woke up early that morning having slept little the previous night and proceeded to prepare for the _big_ day.
Needless to say, I was excited; this day was the first day of eternity with my favorite person on earth.
I left the apartment and saw underneath the windshield wiper of our car the last of five love-letters that Alyssa had hid for me that week.
This made me only more sure of what was going to happen later that day.  

## __Flashback:__ How it all began

Our story began with helping my cousin move his family to a new house (literally down the street from their old house). 
It was one of the final days of the move and my cousin's wife also invited her sister to help with the move.
My cousin's wife introduced her sister to me and we exchanged a quick "nice to meet you" with a handshake.
My cousin's sister-in-law was named Alyssa.

Alyssa and I spoke very briefly during the move, and interestingly enough at that time we were not romantically interested in each other.
A number of months passed without seeing each other, then I ran into Alyssa on campus and asked her out on a date.
As they say, the rest is history...

## Utah Reception
The day after our wedding we had a reception in a local chapel.
It was beautifully decorated, and had an amazing atmosphere.
We are so grateful for those that came to support us.
As the day of the wedding grew closer, more and more people told us that something would inevitably go wrong; however, nothing went wrong with our wedding and reception!! 
(_Except_: after we were married the fire alarm in the [Payson](https://www.lds.org/church/temples/payson-utah?lang=eng) [Temple](https://www.lds.org/church/temples/why-we-build-temples?lang=eng) was engaged. 
We don't consider this as something going wrong, just as something!)

## Honeymoon

Following our reception we drove to St. George, UT for a short honeymoon.
We appreciated the natural beauty
