Hi friend, welcome to my little part of the internet.
As you noticed, my name is Cole. Here is a little bit about the various aspects of my life.

## Academia

I am currently a student at [Brigham Young University](http://byu.edu) studying Computer Science and Bioinformatics. 
If you don't know what Bioinformatics is, you can think of it as studying biology (namely DNA) using computers.
I am also interested in data science and its implications on society. 

I work in the [Computational Sciences Lab](http://csl.cs.byu.edu) at [BYU](http://byu.edu) with [Dr. Mark Clement](http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~clement/).

### Projects

* Implementing a version of GNUMAP (a read aligner) to utilize Graphical Processing Units (GPU).
* Preliminary work for a tool to create synthetic VCF files.

Project at Harvard Medical School Summer Undergraduate Institute:

* Comparison of multiple trajectory reconstruction methods for single-cell RNA-seq.
